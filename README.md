# Leaderboard

In this project, we will build a webapp that will allow us to 
set and pull the results in a leaderboard. In order to do that,
we will use a third party API we wil use the method post to add 
new data and get in order to retrieve data and show it on screen.
This development uses webpack framework and github pages in order to 
deliver on production.
